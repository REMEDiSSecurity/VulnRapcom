# VulnRap.com

## Overview

VulnRap.com — a vulnerability report validation platform (like VirusTotal for bug reports). Allows anonymous users to upload vulnerability reports to check for similarity with other reports and score them for potential AI-generated sloppiness. Reports are auto-redacted before storage to remove PII, secrets, and identifying information.

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Architecture

### Frontend (`artifacts/vulnrap/`)
- React + Vite app at root path "/"
- Route-level code splitting with React.lazy() + Suspense for faster initial load
- Cyberpunk glassmorphism design system: glass cards with backdrop blur, glow text effects, gradient borders (static + animated), colored icon glow backgrounds, cyber grid background, gradient histogram bars, colored stat accent borders, glass navbar/footer
- Animated laser visual effects: background beams, ambient flashes, scan line (respects prefers-reduced-motion)
- Custom AI-generated logo: synthetic bug inspected by lasers (`src/assets/logo.png`, compressed to ~355KB)
- Pages:
  - `/` — Home/submit with logo hero, 3 feature explainer cards, drag-and-drop upload, privacy mode selector, "How It Works" steps, hover hint tooltips
  - `/results/:id` — Analysis results: slop score, auto-redaction summary, similarity matches, section-level analysis with per-section hashes, feedback, expandable redacted report view, verification badge with copy buttons, user feedback form (rating + helpful + suggestions)
  - `/check` — Receiver flow: paste/upload a report for read-only analysis (no storage), shows slop score, duplicates, redaction analysis
  - `/verify/:id` — Public verification page: lightweight badge view with slop score, match counts, content hash, submission date
  - `/stats` — Platform statistics dashboard (metrics, distribution histogram, recent activity) — auto-refreshes every 30s, interactive stat cards with hover details
  - `/developers` — API documentation: quick start guide, all endpoints with curl examples, Swagger UI link, integration ideas (CI/CD, Slack bots, triage dashboards)
  - `/privacy` — Honest privacy policy: explains auto-redaction, what gets stored and compared, how comparison works, data lifecycle
- Uses generated API hooks from `@workspace/api-client-react`
- Dual input: file upload (.txt, .md, 20MB max) or direct text paste via plain-text textarea
- Hover explainer tooltips on all key UI elements
- Text paste field is plain text only -- no HTML rendering, no script execution, content auto-escaped by React JSX

### Auto-Redaction Engine (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/redactor.ts`)
- Deterministic regex-based redaction (same input = same output)
- Redacts: emails, IPs, API keys, JWTs, AWS keys, passwords, connection strings, private keys, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, UUIDs, internal hostnames/URLs, company names, usernames
- Runs on every upload before analysis or storage
- Returns redacted text + summary (counts by category)

### Section Parser (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/section-parser.ts`)
- Parses reports into logical sections (by markdown headers or paragraph breaks)
- Hashes each section independently with SHA-256
- Classifies sections by weight (high/medium/low value)
- Finds exact section matches against existing reports for granular duplicate detection

### Similarity Engine (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/similarity.ts`)
- MinHash + Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for near-duplicate detection
- Deterministic hash coefficients (SHA-256 seeded, stable across restarts)
- Simhash for structural similarity
- SHA-256 content hashing for exact-match deduplication
- Combined scoring: returns top-N matches above threshold

### Sloppiness Scoring (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/sloppiness.ts`)
- Heuristic-based scoring (0-100 scale)
- Checks for: AI-generated phrases, missing version info, missing reproduction steps, missing code blocks, missing attack vector/impact, sentence length analysis, vocabulary diversity
- Tiers: Probably Legit (0-14), Mildly Suspicious (15-29), Questionable (30-49), Highly Suspicious (50-69), Pure Slop (70-100)
- Returns actionable feedback strings

### Upload Pipeline
1. User uploads .txt/.md file OR pastes text directly (plain text only, sanitized server-side)
2. Auto-redaction engine scrubs PII/secrets from raw text
3. All hashing (SHA-256, MinHash, Simhash, LSH, section hashes) runs on redacted text only
4. Similarity comparison against existing redacted reports
5. Section-level hash matching for granular duplicate detection
6. Sloppiness analysis runs on original text (for accurate AI detection)
7. Only redacted text is stored (never raw); in similarity_only mode, not even redacted text is stored

### Privacy Modes
- **full**: Stores redacted report text + all hashes/fingerprints
- **similarity_only**: Stores only hashes/fingerprints, no text at all

### Database Schema (`lib/db/src/schema/`)
- `reports` table: id, content_hash, simhash, minhash_signature, content_text (nullable), redacted_text (nullable), content_mode, slop_score, slop_tier, similarity_matches (jsonb), section_hashes (jsonb), section_matches (jsonb), redaction_summary (jsonb), feedback (jsonb), file_name, file_size, created_at
- `report_hashes` table: indexed hash lookup (sha256, simhash per report)
- `similarity_results` table: pairwise similarity scores
- `report_stats` table: aggregate counters
- `user_feedback` table: id, report_id (optional FK to reports), rating (1-5), helpful (boolean), comment (text), created_at

### User Flows
- **Submitters**: Upload/paste a report → get analysis results → copy verification badge (markdown or plain text) → share with bug bounty program
- **Receivers**: Paste/upload an incoming report on `/check` → see slop score, duplicates, redaction analysis → nothing stored (read-only check)
- **Verification**: Anyone with a verify link (`/verify/:id`) can independently confirm a report's slop score and uniqueness
